# Linked List Practice Implementation and problems

Ordered easiest to hardest
1. Implement a your own Linked List from scratch (with Linked List and Node classes)
2. Pretty Print a linked list in the following format. `10->9->8->7->6->5->4->3->2->1->null`
3. Swap Nodes in a Linked List. [Pursuit](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-DSA/blob/master/problems/LinkedListProblems/SwapNodes.md)
4. Merge two sorted linked lists. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
5. Implement a doubly linked list.
6. Detect a cycle in a linked list. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
7. Implement a Queue with one of your earlier Linked List implementations.
