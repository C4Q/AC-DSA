# Linked List Practice Implementation and problems

Ordered easiest to hardest
1. Implement a your own Linked List from scratch (with a Linked List and Node classes) 
2. Pretty Print a linked list in the following format `10->9->8->7->6->5->4->3->2->1->null'`
3. Merge two sorted linked lists
4. Detect a loop in a linked list
5. Implement a doubly linked list
6. Implement a Queue with one of your earlier Linked List implementations.
